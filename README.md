# RenewSure : Smart Contract Expiry & Renewal Tracker 🔄️⌛ 

## 🔗Project Overview :
Industry: Legal / Business Services
Target Users: Contract Managers, Legal Teams, Business Owners, Compliance Officers
Project Type: Salesforce CRM Implementation

## 🔗Problem Statement :
Many businesses lose revenue and face compliance risks due to missed contract renewals,
duplicate entries, and a lack of automated alerts. Without a proper system, managers only realize
the issue once it’s too late. The current manual methods provide little visibility into upcoming
expiries or renewal trends.
RenewSure solves this by automating contract expiry alerts, preventing duplicates, sending timely
reminders, and giving managers clear dashboards to track contract health.
